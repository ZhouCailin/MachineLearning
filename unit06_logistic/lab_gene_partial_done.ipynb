        "Genes are the basic unit in the DNA and encode blueprints for proteins.  When proteins are synthesized from a gene, the gene is said to \"express\".  Micro-arrays are devices that measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes in parallel.  By finding correlations between expression levels and phenotypes, scientists can identify possible genetic markers for biological characteristics.\n",

We will see if the characteristics can be predicted from the gene expression levels.  This classification could reveal which genes are potentially involved in Down's syndrome and if drugs and learning have any noticeable effects.\n"
