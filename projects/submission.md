# Project Submission Guidelines

Submit one pdf document consisting of and ordered accordingly:
## 1. Your Name, and Net ID
## 2. Quad chart
  Serves as an executive summary. Be concise!Y ou need to very briefly describe what is the motivation, why it should be solved by ML and the tool you picked, what is your contribution (how is it different the existing), results, summary/future directions/lessons learned. 
 ## 3. Your contributions, what did you differently
  There can be ovrelap with quad chart. Explain what part of the project is different from your references, if you got any accuracy improvements, if you used new data or new method etc.
 ## 4. Your Project Report
  A few pages, coherent document in a nice format. You can use figures and diagrams to explain the concepts. You should have one major figure illustrating your results. This may be an accuracy plot, mis-detected images, generated images, ROC curve, .... In the end someone looking at your figure and its description should get a good understanding of your contribution.
 ## 5. The pdf print of your code. 
  I suggest using Jupyter notebook and colab if possibler but of course some projects might require multiple files and local execution. If you can not use jupyter notebook an ordered print of the codebase is also fine. This part is mostly for recording purposes. If you use notebook, please take advantage of text cells and have a self contained document explaining your project. This way you can showcase your work in your github.
